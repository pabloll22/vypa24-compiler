'Assignment given'

Study the specification of a simple programming language VYPlanguage with the
support of the object-oriented paradigm including objects, classes, polymorphism, and
simple inheritance. Based on your findings, create and define its grammar and build a
compiler using the syntax-directed translation. The created compiler will be an executable
file or a bash script named vypcomp. During its execution, the compiler reads a given
input file written in the source language called VYPlanguage and translates it into the target language called VYPcode
